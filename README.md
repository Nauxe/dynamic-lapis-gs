# dynamic-lapis-gs

The extension of LapisGS to dynamic 3DGS. 

The dynamic LapisGS serves as the foundation of our dynamic 3DGS streaming system, "LTS: A DASH Streaming System for Dynamic Multi-Layer 3D Gaussian Splatting Scenes", which will appear in MMSys'25 in April. Check the [preprint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDz1ExOd1LrPhA7fv4DbLUbzn-Jioihn/view?usp=share_link).

Will release the code very soon.
